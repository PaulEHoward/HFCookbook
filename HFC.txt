                               TACO  SALAD

Categories    : One Dish Meals

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1            package  taco seasoning mix -- use TJ's brand
  8             ounces  French salad dressing -- (use Kraft Catalina Dressing)
  4             ounces  taco sauce
  4             ounces  tortilla chips
  8             pieces  iceberg lettuce -- (8 leaves), torn up into bite size pieces
  3                     tomatoes -- diced
  1                can  kidney beans -- (16 oz.) drained
  8             ounces  Colby Cheese -- chopped/shredded

1.  Brown ground beef.  Drain. 
 
2.  Add next 3 ingredients plus the kidney beans.  Mix well.  (No water is
added with the taco seasoning). 
 
3.  Serve the same way as you would serve tacos, i.e., let everyone choose
whether they will add chips, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.  What we do is
put lettuce on our plate, followed by the meat/kidney bean mixture, then
cheese, then tomatoes, then chips.  We mix it all together and voila it's
delicious! 
 
4.  You can refrigerate any of the meat/kidney bean mixture for future
use.  If you had mixed all of the other ingredients with it, e.g., the
lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and chips, the leftovers
the next day would be slimy!  By keeping them separate, you have a great
dish again the next day. 
 
5.  Enjoy!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             medium  potatoes -- (red skin)
  3        Tablespoons  olive oil
  3        Tablespoons  fresh rosemary
  4             cloves  garlic -- pressed
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground pepper

1.  Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch chunks.  Parboil them for 10
minutes, then drain and blot to absorb excess moisture.

Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over a medium flame.  Add the
potatoes, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper.

Toss the potatoes in the pan to coat with oil and herbs, then cook for
10-15 minutes, or crisp and brown.  Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

During the last few minutes of browning, add the tomatoes and olives and
mix gently.  Remove from the heat when tomato skins begin to wrinkle or
brown.  Top with parsley and serve immediately or when cool.

  1         tablespoon  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  water -- warm
  1                cup  skim milk -- scalded
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  shortening
  1           teaspoon  salt

  1                     egg
  1                cup  brown sugar
     1/2           cup  butter
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup

     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon

1.  Soften yeast in the water.  Combine milk, sugar, shortening, salt. 
Cool; until lukewarm. 

2.  Add 1 1/2 C. flour.  Beat well.  Add the yeast and egg.  Gradually add
the remaining 2C. of flour, beating well.

3.  Place in greased bowl, turn to grease surface.  Let rise till double
(1 1/2-2 hours).  OR do not let it rise.  Put turned, greased dough into
refrigerator.  Cover.  Chill at least 2 hours, or up to 4-5 days.  If you
do this, start the next stage about 2 hours before serving.

4.  In a saucepan, mix 1 C. brown sugar, 1/2 C. butter, 1 T. light corn
syrup, and 1 t. honey.  Heat slowly, stirring often.  Pour into a 9x11

6.  Roll out half the dough into a 16x8 inch rectangle.  Put half the
sugar mixture on the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch along the long edge
free to seal together.  Roll it up like a jellyroll, and cut 1" slices. 
It should come out to about 16 pieces.  Put the slices cut side down on
the syrup.  Repeat with the other half of the dough.  

7.  Let rise until double (35-45 minutes).    Bake at 375 about 20
minutes.  Cool 2-3 minutes.  Flip upside down on Aluminum foil sheet.

8.  Put AL foil on entire lower shelf of oven.

     3/8         pound  Gruyere cheese -- shredded (4 tenths of a pound)
     3/8         pound  Fontina cheese -- shredded (4 tenths of a pound)
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese -- finely grated
  5          teaspoons  flour
  4             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- grated (or less, see the last instruction)
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  dry sherry
  1 1/2           cups  skim milk
     3/4         pound  shell pasta

Prepare cheeses.

Toss the Gruyere, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses with flour. (Leave
Mozzarella separate.)

Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt.

Heat butter and milk in a large, heavy-bottomed sauce pan until the butter
is melted.

Stir in the three combined chesses a little at a time.  Continue stirring
with a wooden spoon until you have a smooth sauce.

Stir in sherry

Keep sauce hot over a low flame stirring occasionally if  pasta is not
done yet.

Drain pasta and transfer to a large, warmed serving bowl.  Pour the cheese
sauce over the pasta and stir quickly with two spoons.

Just before serving, stir in the Mozzarella.  The more mozzarella you put
in the stringier the finished product.  I usually add 1/4 cup only. Serve
on heated plates.

                        (rosemary??)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  paprika -- just sprinkle, don't measure

1.  Fill a large glass or metal mixing bowl half full of hot water and let
sit for 15 seconds.

2.  Leave 1/2 cup of the hot water in the bowl and dump the rest.

3.  Add the 3/8 teaspoon sugar in the 1/2 cup of hot water, stirring to
dissolve the sugar.  

4.  Sprinkle the yeast onto the water and LET SIT FOR 5 MINUTES; DO NOT
STIR.

5.  While the yeast is sitting, warm the milk, olive oil, sugar and salt
in sauce pan.  Test the temperature with your finger to make sure it is
not too hot.

6.  When the 5 minutes is up, stir the yeast mixture to disolve the yeast
and add the warm (NOT HOT) milk mixture.  

7.  Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and beat on high for 3 minutes or beat with a
spoon for 5 minutes.

8.  Gradually stir in 2 to 2 1/2 cups more flour to make a soft dough (not
sticky and not dry) and knead for 5 minutes in machine or 10 by hand.

9.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.  Cover wtih
plastic wrap and a towel.  Let rise for 1 to 2 hours.

10.  Divide dough in half.  Each half will make 12 rolls or 1 loaf of
bread.

11.  For rolls, divide the dough (1/2 recipe) into 12 equal peices, form
into balls and place in a greased cake pan.  Brush the tops with oil.

12.  For onion bread: spread the dough (1/2 recipe) evenly on the bottom
of a greased cake pan. Brush the top with oil.

refrigerate until 30 minutes before baking.  Take plastic wrap off when
out of the fridge.
