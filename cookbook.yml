    :name: kidney beans -- (16 oz.) drained
  - :amount: '8'
    :measure: ounces
    :name: Colby Cheese -- chopped/shredded
  :directions:
  - Brown ground beef.  Drain.
  - Add next 3 ingredients plus the kidney beans.  Mix well.  (No water is added with
    the taco seasoning).
  - Serve the same way as you would serve tacos, i.e., let everyone choose whether
    they will add chips, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.  What we do is put lettuce
    on our plate, followed by the meat/kidney bean mixture, then cheese, then tomatoes,
    then chips.  We mix it all together and voila it's delicious!
  - You can refrigerate any of the meat/kidney bean mixture for future use.  If you
    had mixed all of the other ingredients with it, e.g., the lettuce, cheese, tomatoes,
    and chips, the leftovers the next day would be slimy!  By keeping them separate,
    you have a great dish again the next day.
  - Enjoy!

  :directions:
  - Prepare cheeses.
  - Toss the Gruyere, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses with flour. (Leave Mozzarella separate.)
  - Cook pasta according to package directions, omitting salt.
  - Heat butter and milk in a large, heavy-bottomed sauce pan until the butter is
    melted.
  - Stir in the three combined chesses a little at a time.  Continue stirring with
    a wooden spoon until you have a smooth sauce.
  - Stir in sherry
  - Keep sauce hot over a low flame stirring occasionally if  pasta is not done yet.
  - Drain pasta and transfer to a large, warmed serving bowl.  Pour the cheese sauce
    over the pasta and stir quickly with two spoons.
  - Just before serving, stir in the Mozzarella.  The more mozzarella you put in the
    stringier the finished product.  I usually add 1/4 cup only. Serve on heated plates.

    with a wooden spoon until smooth (150 strokes).  Scrape sides of bowl occasionally.
    4.  Stir in 2- 3 cups of remaining flour gradually.  Use enough flour to make
    a soft dough which leaves sides of bowl, adding more if necessary. Turn out onto
    floured board.  Round up into a ball. 5.  Knead 5-10 minutes or until dough is
    smooth, elastic and no longer sticky. 6.  Cover with plastic wrap, then a towel.  Let
    rest for 20 minutes on board.  Punch down. 7.  Divide and shape into two coffee
    cakes or 2 1/2 - 3 dozen rolls as desired. 8.  Place in greased baking pans or
    on greased baking sheets (an 8 inch square pan is ideal for 1 dozen rolls and
    a 9 x 13 inch pan for 1 1/2 dozen rolls.) 9.  Brush surface of dough with oil.  Cover
    loosely with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours. 10.  Remove
    from refrigerator and let stand for 10 minutes.  Puncture any surface bubbles
    before baking. 11.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until done.  Use
    lower rack for best results. 12.  Remove from pans immediately and cool on racks.
    13.  Brush with margarine or frost.

    :name: paprika -- just sprinkle, don't measure
  :directions:
  - Fill a large glass or metal mixing bowl half full of hot water and let sit for
    15 seconds.
  - Leave 1/2 cup of the hot water in the bowl and dump the rest.
  - Add the 3/8 teaspoon sugar in the 1/2 cup of hot water, stirring to dissolve the
    sugar.
  - Sprinkle the yeast onto the water and LET SIT FOR 5 MINUTES; DO NOT STIR.
  - While the yeast is sitting, warm the milk, olive oil, sugar and salt in sauce
    pan.  Test the temperature with your finger to make sure it is not too hot.
  - When the 5 minutes is up, stir the yeast mixture to disolve the yeast and add
    the warm (NOT HOT) milk mixture.
  - Add 2 1/2 cups of flour and beat on high for 3 minutes or beat with a spoon for
    5 minutes.
  - Gradually stir in 2 to 2 1/2 cups more flour to make a soft dough (not sticky
    and not dry) and knead for 5 minutes in machine or 10 by hand.
  - Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.  Cover wtih plastic wrap
    and a towel.  Let rise for 1 to 2 hours.
  - Divide dough in half.  Each half will make 12 rolls or 1 loaf of bread.
  - For rolls, divide the dough (1/2 recipe) into 12 equal peices, form into balls
    and place in a greased cake pan.  Brush the tops with oil.
  - 'For onion bread: spread the dough (1/2 recipe) evenly on the bottom of a greased
    cake pan. Brush the top with oil.'
  - Sprinkle the onions on top and press them into the dough.  Sprinkle the other
    ingredients evenly over the top, ending with the paprika.
  - Cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit 30 minutes before baking, or refrigerate until
    30 minutes before baking.  Take plastic wrap off when out of the fridge.
