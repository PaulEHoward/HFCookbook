    :measure: tablespoon
    :name: prepared mustard
  - :amount: '1'
    :measure: tablespoon
    :name: vinegar
  :directions:
  - Brown pork in large nonstick skillet with 1/2 teaspoon canola oil.
  - Mix cranberry sauce, mustard and vinegar.  Pour over chops.
  - Cover and simmer gently for 5 minutes or until done.
  - Brown ground beef.  Drain.
  - Add next 3 ingredients plus the kidney beans.  Mix well.  (No water is added with
    the taco seasoning).
  - Serve the same way as you would serve tacos, i.e., let everyone choose whether
    they will add chips, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.  What we do is put lettuce
    on our plate, followed by the meat/kidney bean mixture, then cheese, then tomatoes,
    then chips.  We mix it all together and voila it's delicious!
  - You can refrigerate any of the meat/kidney bean mixture for future use.  If you
    had mixed all of the other ingredients with it, e.g., the lettuce, cheese, tomatoes,
    and chips, the leftovers the next day would be slimy!  By keeping them separate,
    you have a great dish again the next day.
  - Enjoy!
  - Mix the bulgur with 1 1/2 C boiling water.  Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Drain
    thoroughly.  The wheat will expand quite a bit.

  - Place the potatoes in a large pot; cover with water.  Bring to a boil over medium
    high heat; simmer until the potatoes are tender--20-30 minutes.  Drain thoroughly;
    return them to the pot in which they were cooked.
  - Using a hand held electric mixer, beat the mascarpone and butter into the potatoes
    until thoroughly incorporated and fluffy.  Season with salt and pepper.  Beat
    in the chives (if you use them--I don't).
  - Transfer the potatoes to an 11 x 7 buttered pyrex baking dish. Sprinkle the Parmesan
    cheese over the top.  Sprinkle with the nutmeg and paprika.  Cover the potatoes
    with plastic wrap; refrigerate for up to 48 hours before heating.
  - When ready to heat the potatoes, bring them to room temperature. Preheat the oven
    to 350 degrees.  Bake the potatoes until hot, puffed and light golden brown on

    4.  Stir in 2- 3 cups of remaining flour gradually.  Use enough flour to make
    a soft dough which leaves sides of bowl, adding more if necessary. Turn out onto
    floured board.  Round up into a ball. 5.  Knead 5-10 minutes or until dough is
    smooth, elastic and no longer sticky. 6.  Cover with plastic wrap, then a towel.  Let
    rest for 20 minutes on board.  Punch down. 7.  Divide and shape into two coffee
    cakes or 2 1/2 - 3 dozen rolls as desired. 8.  Place in greased baking pans or
    on greased baking sheets (an 8 inch square pan is ideal for 1 dozen rolls and
    a 9 x 13 inch pan for 1 1/2 dozen rolls.) 9.  Brush surface of dough with oil.  Cover
    loosely with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours. 10.  Remove
    from refrigerator and let stand for 10 minutes.  Puncture any surface bubbles
    before baking. 11.  Bake at 375 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until done.  Use
    lower rack for best results. 12.  Remove from pans immediately and cool on racks.
    13.  Brush with margarine or frost.
