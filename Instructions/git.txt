Began with 
$ git init
in the main directory.  Then
$ git add -A
then
$git commit -m "Initial commit."
then
$ heroku login 
and entered my email and password: Y1kyanSabms
This didn't work.  The computer just hung.  It turned out that the problem
was the file ~/.netrc which had the same entry about 3000 times.  After
deleting all but one occurrence the login worked.
Then tried (to put the app on heroku)
$ heroku create axiom-of-choice-from-phoward-s
which worked.  Then (after a few misteps) I
Created a gemfile by copying the gemfile from SinatraWorksapce
then 
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
Then, to add the gem file to the commits:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Commit before pusing to heroku."
and finally 
$ git push heroku master
