(git.txt from ~/axiom-of-choice-from-phoward-s/instructions/ modified for
 the Cookbook program)
Began with 
$ git init
in the main directory.  Then
$ git add -A
then
$git commit -m "Initial commit."
then
$ heroku login 
and entered my email and password: Y1kyanSabms (Got a new password)
This didn't work.  The computer just hung.  It turned out that the problem
was the file ~/.netrc which had the same entry about 3000 times.  After
deleting all but one occurrence the login worked.
Then tried (to put the app on heroku)
$ heroku create hfcookbook
which worked.  Then (after a few misteps) I
Created a gemfile by copying the gemfile from axiom-of-choice-from-phoward-s but I added the line (to Gemfile)

gem "yaml"

then 
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
Then, to add the gem file to the commits:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Commit before pusing to heroku."
and finally 
$ git push heroku master
(this command is used to deploy revisions too)
Looks like going to 
https://hfcookbook.herokuapp.com/
will give me the app on heroku.
But I got an error page
"Appliction Error ..."
heroku logs --tail for details
Had some problems
Added gem "puma" to Gemfile
Created a Procfile with
web: bundle exec puma -t 5:5 -p ${PORT:-3000} -e ${RACK_ENV:-development}
ran bundle install

In the config.ru file I have
require './HFCookBook.rb'
run Sinatra::Application

Then running
heroku local
runs the app locally just like it would run on heroku.

did the git add -A, git commit , git push heroku master

Went to
https://hfcookbook.herokuapp.com/
Success!
