(git.txt from ~/axiom-of-choice-from-phoward-s/instructions/ modified for
 the Cookbook program)
Began with 
$ git init
in the main directory.  Then
$ git add -A
then
$git commit -m "Initial commit."
then
$ heroku login 
and entered my email and password: Y1kyanSabms (Got a new password)
This didn't work.  The computer just hung.  It turned out that the problem
was the file ~/.netrc which had the same entry about 3000 times.  After
deleting all but one occurrence the login worked.
Then tried (to put the app on heroku)
$ heroku create hfcookbook
which worked.  Then (after a few misteps) I
Created a gemfile by copying the gemfile from axiom-of-choice-from-phoward-s but I added the line (to Gemfile)

gem "yaml"

then 
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
Then, to add the gem file to the commits:
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Commit before pusing to heroku."
and finally 
$ git push heroku master
(this command is used to deploy revisions too)
Looks like going to 
https://hfcookbook.herokuapp.com/
will give me the app on heroku.
But I got an error page
"Appliction Error ..."
heroku logs --tail for details
Had some problems
Added gem "puma" to Gemfile
Created a Procfile with
web: bundle exec puma -t 5:5 -p ${PORT:-3000} -e ${RACK_ENV:-development}
ran bundle install

In the config.ru file I have
require './HFCookBook.rb'
run Sinatra::Application

Then running
heroku local
runs the app locally just like it would run on heroku.

did the git add -A, git commit , git push heroku master

Went to
https://hfcookbook.herokuapp.com/
Success!

But See the note below on pushing to heroku

Making a Git repository:

Went to github.com and signed in.  Clicked on "repositories" tab.
Clicked on "new" under "find a repository".  
Entered "HFCookbook" as the title
Then from the command line:
git remote add origin git@github.com:PaulEHoward/HFCookbook.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
the last command didn't work.  I had following the directions here then repeat the command
https://gist.github.com/adamjohnson/5682757

I assume git push -u origin main

will push new versions to github.

March 21:  the git push -u origin main failed.
To get this to work I followed the directions here: 
https://gist.github.com/adamjohnson/5682757
Starting with
cd ~/.ssh
The files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub did not appear so I entered
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "phoward@emich.edu"
then opened id_rsa.pub and copied the contents.  Then logged into my github account and under Account Settings clicked on SSH and GPG keys.  Then on ""New SSH key" and pasted the key.  And now
git push -u origin main 
works.

AND NOW to push to heroku requires 

git push heroku main
