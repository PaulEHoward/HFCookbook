1.  Added to pagelayout.erb
<header>
  <h1>Howard Family Cookbook - <%= @title || 'Untitled' %> </h1>
  <%= erb :nav %>
  <br>
  <form method = "POST" action = "/search">
    <p> Ingredient Search: <input type="text" name = "st" value="enter an indgredient"> </p>
    <input type = "submit" />
  </form>
</header>

2.  Added to HFCookBook.rb

post '/search' do
  @title = "search results for #{params[:st].to_s}"
  @recipetitles = recipeSearch(cookbook, params[:st]) # recipeSearch
             # is a method in the /methods/cbmethods file
             # which inputs a category and returns an
             # array of pairs for each recipe
             # (with the search term in its ingredients)  ["title", "incex in cookbook]
  erb :recipelist, :layout => :pagelayout
  to HFCookBook.rb

3.  Add to the file ./methods/cbmethods.rb the method recipeSearch(cb,st) which
inputs
# the cookbook array and a search term (params[:st])
# and returns an array of pairs [recipetitle, recipe id].

4.  Add to the <header> in pagelayout.rb
<form method = "POST" action = "/search">
  <p> Ingredient Search: <input type="text" name = "st" value="enter an indgredient"> </p>
  <input type = "submit" />
</form>
(then, supposedly, the search term st can be accessed in HFCookBook.rb as params[:st].to_s.)

There were some problems in using the updated program but updating ruby took care of them
