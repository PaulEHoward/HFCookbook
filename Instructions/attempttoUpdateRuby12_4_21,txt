Working on the MacBookPro at home:

Began with 

> sudo apt-get remove ruby

(following instructions at 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37720892/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-var-lib-gems-2-3-0-directory
)

cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
ruby -v

gem install bundler
rbenv rehash

Worked!

Then 

bundle install 

worked (but I had to eliminate gem "pg" from Gemfile
