Working on the MacBookPro at home:

Began with 

> sudo apt-get remove ruby

(following instructions at 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37720892/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-var-lib-gems-2-3-0-directory
)

cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
ruby -v

gem install bundler
rbenv rehash

Worked!

Then 

bundle install 

worked (but I had to eliminate gem "pg" from Gemfile)

Then
> git add -A
> git commit -m "Update ruby ...."
> git push heroku main

after which either of

> heroku local

or 

going to 

https://hfcookbook.herokuapp.com/

gave me the cook book.

To push to github:

cd ~/.ssh
The files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub did not appear so I entered
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "phoward@emich.edu"
(accepting the defaults)
then opened id_rsa.pub and copied the contents.  Then logged into my github account and under Account Settings (From the menu in the upper right hand corner click on "settings") clicked on SSH and GPG keys.  Then on ""New SSH key" and pasted the key.  And now
git push -u origin main
